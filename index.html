            <p>We would like to invite you to The Metamorphosis Experience, a weekend workshop which will be held in Toronto, Canada in August 2025.</p>

            <p>This 2.5-day experiential workshop is an opportunity to discover who you are when you don't hold anything back. Using somatic practices of Core Energetics, and the healing power of the group, we'll help you access, express, and liberate the long-held feelings that have kept you from living as your true self.</p>

            <p>We all have parts of ourselves that we hide out of deep-rooted fear or shame. As a result, we live a half-life, cut off from a vital energy inside that we sense, but don't have full access to. This results in a life lived with diminished intuition, expression, and creativity.</p>

            <p>In this workshop, our intention is to support you to re-connect to the places inside that you have disowned, so that you can come into your full power, and experience what it feels like to be alive, connected, and present.</p>

            <p>For those of you who have been interested in the 4-Year Metamorphosis Core Energetics Institute, this will give you a taste of the transformative power of that program.</p>

            <p>If this feels exciting to you, or scary, join us!</p>

            <p>Love,</p>

            <p>Jana and Angela</p>
